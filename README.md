# Introduction-to-arduino-programming
# Arduino Learning Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Arduino projects I built while learning the basics of microcontroller programming. Each project demonstrates the use of fundamental functions like `digitalWrite()`, `pinMode()`, `delay()`, and more.

## 🔧 Projects Included
- **LED Control via Serial Input**: Choose which bulb to light up using the Serial Monitor.
- **Traffic Light Simulation**: Mimics a basic traffic light using LEDs and delays.
- **Button-Activated LED**: Lights up an LED when a button is pressed.
- **Blinking LED**: The classic "Hello World" of Arduino.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Setting up digital pins as input/output
- Reading from the Serial Monitor
- Using conditional logic to control hardware
- Structuring code with `setup()` and `loop()`

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- LEDs, resistors, jumper wires
- Arduino IDE

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE
3. Upload to your board and follow the instructions in the Serial Monitor

## 📬 Feedback
Feel free to fork, star, or suggest improvements. I'm learning and open to collaboration!
